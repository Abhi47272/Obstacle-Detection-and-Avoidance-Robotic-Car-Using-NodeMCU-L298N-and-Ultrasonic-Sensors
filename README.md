Obstacle Detection and Avoidance Robotic Car Using NodeMCU, L298N, and Ultrasonic Sensors
Project Overview
This project presents a cost-effective, autonomous robotic car designed for real-time obstacle detection and shortest-path navigation within structured environments, such as warehouses. The system is built around the NodeMCU (ESP8266) microcontroller, L298N motor driver, and ultrasonic sensors, leveraging Dijkstra’s algorithm for efficient path planning and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The solution is intended for applications in warehouse automation, educational robotics, and basic autonomous navigation tasks1.

Key Objectives
Develop a low-cost, scalable motion planning and obstacle avoidance system using affordable components (NodeMCU, ultrasonic sensors).

Enable real-time obstacle detection and avoidance through sensor integration and dynamic local planning.

Optimize path planning by implementing shortest-path algorithms (Dijkstra’s, A*) for efficient navigation.

Integrate IoT capabilities for remote monitoring and wireless control.

Ensure energy efficiency and adaptability for small to large-scale environments1.

Literature Context
Path Planning: Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms are foundational for finding optimal paths in static or semi-dynamic environments. Local planning methods (e.g., Bug algorithms, Vector Field Histogram) help with real-time obstacle avoidance.

Sensor Technologies: Ultrasonic sensors are widely used for close-range obstacle detection due to their affordability, though they have limitations in noisy or complex environments. More advanced systems might use LiDAR or sensor fusion for higher accuracy.

NodeMCU in Robotics: NodeMCU’s compact size, low power consumption, and Wi-Fi capabilities make it suitable for embedded robotics and IoT integration, enabling real-time data processing and remote operation1.

System Design and Methodology
1. Hardware Components

NodeMCU ESP8266: Central processing and Wi-Fi communication.

Ultrasonic Sensors (e.g., HC-SR04): Detect obstacles and measure distances.

L298N Motor Driver: Controls DC motors for movement.

Servo Motor: Rotates ultrasonic sensor for environmental scanning.

Chassis, Power Supply, and Wiring: Physical structure and connectivity1.

2. Navigation and Control

The warehouse environment is mapped digitally (grid or coordinate system).

The NodeMCU runs Dijkstra’s or A* algorithm to compute the shortest route from start to destination.

Ultrasonic sensors mounted on a servo scan for obstacles. If an obstacle is detected within a threshold (e.g., <20 cm), the car halts, recalculates the path, and selects a new direction.

The system uses both global (path optimization) and local (real-time obstacle avoidance) planning for robust navigation1.

3. Software Implementation

Firmware is developed using Arduino IDE.

Key libraries: NewPing.h (ultrasonic sensor), Servo.h (servo control), ESP8266WiFi.h (Wi-Fi).

The control algorithm initializes sensors, scans for obstacles, measures distances, makes navigation decisions, and sends commands to the motor driver for movement1.

4. Testing and Refinement

Initial tests are conducted in controlled environments.

Performance metrics include path efficiency, obstacle response time, and task completion rates.

Iterative adjustments are made to sensor calibration, algorithm parameters, and hardware configuration for optimal performance1.

Results and Performance
Accuracy: The system reliably detects static obstacles within 20–30 cm and recalculates paths using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

Efficiency: Optimal pathfinding is achieved in simple, structured environments. The system maintains a safe distance from obstacles and avoids collisions.

Limitations: NodeMCU’s limited processing power introduces delays in complex or densely populated environments. Ultrasonic sensors may yield false readings on reflective surfaces or in dynamic settings.

Energy Efficiency: The NodeMCU-based system is power-efficient, suitable for battery-operated mobile robots. Power consumption increases with frequent path recalculations, but remains lower than more advanced platforms1.

Comparison with Advanced Systems
NodeMCU-based systems are ideal for basic navigation and obstacle avoidance in simple environments due to their low cost and energy efficiency.

Advanced systems (using LiDAR, SLAM, or deep learning) offer higher accuracy, adaptability, and environmental mapping capabilities, but are more expensive and power-hungry.

Sensor capabilities: While ultrasonic sensors suffice for basic tasks, LiDAR or sensor fusion is preferred for complex, dynamic environments1.
